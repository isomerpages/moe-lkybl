<h3>Connecting Communities &amp; Bridging Generations
Through Our Mother Tongue Languages</h3>
<p>In 2018, the Fund launched a series of short videos in its continuous drive to encourage the use of
Mother Tongue languages among Singaporeans, especially children and parents. The video series
highlights the importance of our Mother Tongue in connecting users; hearts and minds, by bringing
people closer to one another.</p>
