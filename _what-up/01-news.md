**IAmBilingualSG Call for Projects** 
<br/>To encourage bilingualism and the learning of our Mother Tongue Languages as a living language and lifelong endeavour, the Lee Kuan Yew Fund for Bilingualism (the “Fund”) launched a #IAmBilingualSG Call for Projects to support the nurturing of bilingualism in young children at home.
From 6 May to 31 July 2020, the Fund will invite submissions of digital resources that are user-friendly and can help parents/caregivers engage and coach their young children (aged 0-6) in the learning and enjoyment of MTLs. The Fund has set aside S$1 million for this initiative and each successful application will receive up to S$10,000 in grants depending on the quality, complexity and creativity of their submission. On a case-by-case basis, the Fund will consider awarding higher funding amounts for more complex and substantive projects with the potential for further development.
    This initiative is open to individuals (Singaporeans or Permanent Residents) and organisations/institutions (Singapore-based). Applicants may submit more than one submission as long as the content is different. Selected projects may be hosted on Lee Kuan Yew Fund for Bilingualism website, its Facebook page and other social platforms.<br/>
Applicants are encouraged to read the FAQ carefully before submitting an application. [attachment]
