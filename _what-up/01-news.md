**#IAmBilingualSG Call for Projects** 
<br/>To encourage bilingualism and the learning of our Mother Tongue Languages as a living language and lifelong endeavour, the Lee Kuan Yew Fund for Bilingualism (the “Fund”) launched a #IAmBilingualSG Call for Projects to support the nurturing of bilingualism in young children at home.<br/>From 6 May to 31 July 2020, the Fund will invite submissions of digital resources that are user-friendly and can help parents/caregivers engage and coach their young children (aged 0-6) in the learning and enjoyment of MTLs. The Fund has set aside S$1 million for this initiative and each successful application will receive up to S$10,000 in grants depending on the quality, complexity and creativity of their submission. On a case-by-case basis, the Fund will consider awarding higher funding amounts for more complex and substantive projects with the potential for further development. <br/> This initiative is open to individuals (Singaporeans or Permanent Residents) and organisations/institutions (Singapore-based). Applicants may submit more than one submission as long as the content is different. Selected projects may be hosted on <a href="http://www.bilingualism.sg/" target="_blank">Lee Kuan Yew Fund for Bilingualism website</a>, its <a href="https://www.facebook.com/bilingualismsg" target="_blank">Facebook page</a> and other social platforms.<br/>

The Fund has launched a series of short videos in its continuous drive to encourage the use of Mother Tongue languages among Singaporeans, especially young children. Building on the Fund’s efforts over the past six years in promoting the teaching and learning of Mother Tongue languages, the video series highlights the importance of our Mother Tongue in connecting users’ hearts and minds, by bringing people closer to one another.

The series of videos can also be viewed online at the Ministry of Education’s YouTube pages <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/MOESpore" target="_blank">www.youtube.com/MOESpore</a><br/>
