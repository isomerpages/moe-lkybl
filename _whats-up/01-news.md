<img src="/images/Slide2.jpg" style="height:300px">
<br/>To encourage bilingualism and the learning of our Mother Tongue Languages as a living language and lifelong endeavour, the Lee Kuan Yew Fund for Bilingualism (the “Fund”) launched a #IAmBilingualSG Call for Projects to support the nurturing of bilingualism in young children at home.<br/><br/> From 6 May to 31 July 2020, the Fund will invite submissions of digital resources that are user-friendly and can help parents/caregivers engage and coach their young children (aged 0-6) in the learning and enjoyment of MTLs. The Fund has set aside S$1 million for this initiative and each successful application will receive up to S$10,000 in grants depending on the quality, complexity and creativity of their submission. On a case-by-case basis, the Fund will consider awarding higher funding amounts for more complex and substantive projects with the potential for further development. <br/><br/>  This initiative is open to individuals (Singaporeans or Permanent Residents) and organisations/institutions (Singapore-based). Applicants may submit more than one submission as long as the content is different. Selected projects may be hosted on <a href="http://www.bilingualism.sg/" target="_blank">Lee Kuan Yew Fund for Bilingualism website</a>, its <a href="https://www.facebook.com/bilingualismsg" target="_blank">Facebook page</a> and other social platforms.<br/>
Applicants are encouraged to read the FAQ carefully before submitting an application.
