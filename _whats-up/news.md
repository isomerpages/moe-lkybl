Connecting Communities & Bridging Generations Through our Mother Tongue Languages</h4>
<p>In 2018, the Fund launched a series of short videos in its continuous drive to encourage the use of
Mother Tongue languages among Singaporeans, especially children and parents. The video series
highlights the importance of our Mother Tongue in connecting users; hearts and minds, by bringing
people closer to one another.<br/> The series of five videos comprises:</p>
<p>1. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTXKA3l0K4" target="_blank"><u>A short video on how the use of Mother Tongue breaks down the language barrier between a grandfather and his granddaughter</u></a>; and</p>
<p>2. Four testimonial videos featuring then-Minister for Education (Schools) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AwdyxUDBC0" target="_blank"><u>Mr Ng Chee Meng</u></a> ,and Singapore artistes,<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xG4QFdFxlFE" target="_blank"><u>Ms Olivia Ong</u></a>,<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkzHGh8vJF0" target="_blank"><u>Mr Shabir Alam</u></a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpemu3KYx2M" target="_blank"><u>Mr Taufik Batisah</u></a>. They talk about their
experience in learning their Mother Tongue language, and how it helped them appreciate the language and connect better with others.
