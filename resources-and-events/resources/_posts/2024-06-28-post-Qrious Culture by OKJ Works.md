<p>In pursuit of the Fundâ€™s strategic shift towards youth engagement, LKYFB
collaborated with OKJ Works to develop 4 video podcasts and an event showcase
to inspire youths through documentary stories. Episodes 1 and 2 of a four-part
video podcast series are now available for viewing. This project, titled
Qrious Culture, started in April 2024 and will extend into September 2024.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Qrious Culture offers a unique outreach strategy aimed at organically
fostering new opportunities for bilingual engagement with youths and young
adults. The video podcasts inspire youths to embrace their bilingual edge
through stories of growth and self-discovery from four youth filmmakers
interviewed this season. Following the viewing of the 4 video podcasts,
engagement sessions with approximately 150 IHL students will be conducted
for participants to share their own bilingual journey and engage in panel
discussions. The event showcase concluding this project offers an empowering
platform for youths to create bilingual content and share their personal
insights.</p>
