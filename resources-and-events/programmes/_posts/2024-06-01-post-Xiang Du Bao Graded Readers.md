<p>The Lee Kuan Yew Fund for Bilingualism is proud to have contributed to
the development and successful launch of the Xiang Du Bao (XDB) Graded
Readers for Kindergarteners. This unique series beautifully blends the
aesthetics of Chinese literature with stories that are both engaging and
relatable to young children.</p>
<p>Embark on delightful adventures with Qi Qi and Yang Yang as they explore
their joyful everyday experiences in the Xiang Du Bao Graded Readers Series!</p>
<p>Xiang Du Bao Graded Readers<strong> </strong>comprises eight stories specifically
designed for Kindergarten 1 students. These stories focus on the familiar
theme of "Me," presented through the delightful experiences of two lovable
characters, Qi Qi and Yang Yang. The stories are brought to life with enchanting
illustrations by the beloved local artist, Eliz Ong.</p>
<p>Each reader includes post-reading activities with reusable stickers, offering
a hands-on, interactive experience that allows children to play and learn
repeatedly.</p>
<p>To enhance the reading experience, all 8 readers in Level 1 are accompanied
by audio recordings accessible through the ChildEd Let's Read App. Narrated
by Dr Sin, these recordings provide children with the opportunity to read
along with Qi Qi and Yang Yang, enriching their learning experience with
clear and engaging articulation.</p>
<p>Join us in nurturing a love for reading and bilingualism with the Xiang
Du Bao Graded Readers Series, where each story is a step towards a lifelong
journey of learning and discovery.</p>
