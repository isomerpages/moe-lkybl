Lee Kuan Yew Fund for Bilingualism is excited to be part of this year's Mother Tongue Language Symposium (MTLS) 2024. LKYFB will be sharing the resources we have built and supported over the years in support of the theme, 'Our Mother Tongues as Living Languages'.

Mother tongues are not just a means of communication; they are a repository of culture, history, and identity. When children learn their mother tongue, they gain a deeper understanding of their cultural heritage and traditions. This connection to their roots fosters a sense of pride and belonging, which is essential for their emotional and social development. Celebrating and using mother tongues in everyday life helps keep cultural traditions alive and promotes a diverse and inclusive society.

Embracing our mother tongues as living languages is fundamental to improving children's linguistic and bilingual capacities. By valuing and promoting the use of native languages, we not only enhance cognitive and academic skills but also preserve cultural heritage and foster a sense of identity. Through the combined efforts of families, educators, and communities, we can ensure that our mother tongues continue to thrive, enriching the lives of future generations.
