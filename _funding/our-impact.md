<h3>Our Impact</h3>
<p>Since its inception, the Lee Kuan Yew Fund for Bilingualism has held true
to its mission of enabling a steady pipeline of locally contextualised
and age-appropriate resources and programmes to foster bilingualism in
children. The focus has been on pre-schoolers, or even younger children
because the foundation for learning both English and Mother Tongue Languages
(MTLs) is best laid when children are young. Besides focusing on pre-schoolers,
we have also broadened our focus to promote bilingualism as a lifelong
endeavour.

<p>We work closely with like-minded stakeholders and community partners,
individuals and entities to support worthy initiatives and programmes in
making MTL learning fun and relevant to everyday life. Some of the partners
we have worked with are:</p>
