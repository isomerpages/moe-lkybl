###  Our Impact
<div><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since its inception, the Lee Kuan Yew Fund for Bilingualism has held true to its mission of enabling a steady pipeline of locally contextualised and age-appropriate resources and programmes to foster bilingualism in children.  The focus has been on pre-schoolers, or even younger children, because the foundation for learning both the English and Mother Tongue Languages (MTLs) is best laid when children are young.  Besides focusing on pre-schoolers, we have also broadened our focus to promote bilingualism as a lifelong endeavour. </p></div>
