 <div><h3> Call for Proposals</h3>
<div><p>The Lee Kuan Yew Fund for Bilingualism invites you to submit proposals to promote bilingualism among pre-school children.</p></div><br/>
<div><p>Bilingual education is a cornerstone of our education system. Learning two languages helps
Singaporeans plug into a globalised world and strengthen links to our Asian heritage.</p><div>
<div><p>Research has shown that exposure in early years is effective for nurturing bilingualism and the
learning of multiple languages. Strengthening our efforts to encourage bilingualism in the early
years, especially in listening and speaking capabilities, would provide our children with a headstart in
language acquisition and lay a stronger foundation for bilingual learning in their later years.</p><div>
<div><p>The Lee Kuan Yew Fund for Bilingualism welcome  proposals that have the potential to create an
impact on promoting bilingualism among pre-school children in pre-school, at home and in the
community. Please note that the Fund is currently not accepting any research-related proposals.</p><div>
<div><p><strong>The Fund has set specific periods for Call for Proposals (CFP) in January and July each year.  Proposals that are received outside of the CFP period will only be evaluated during the next CFP.  <br/>When to apply:</strong></p><div>
