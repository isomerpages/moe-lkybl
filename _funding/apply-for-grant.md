<p>Note to applicants:
<br>Calls for Proposals (CFP) are made to invite aspiring publishers, artists,
content developers, authors, or individuals who may be interested in developing
programmes or resources to promote bilingualism in Singapore. The recently
concluded CFP 10 was designated as a Special Call with a core focus on
funding applications for bilingual events and programmes, such as plays/dramas,
booths/exhibitions, competitions, social media campaigns, etc.</p>
<p><strong>The Fund has set specific periods for Call for Proposals (CFP) in January and July each year. Proposals that are received outside of the CFP period will only be evaluated during the next CFP.</strong>
