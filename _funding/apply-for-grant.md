<b>Applicants interested to produce a series of children's picture books with a local context may apply for the Special Call for Proposals (Picture Books), from 1 to 31 August 2022. <br>For more information, click <a href="https://www.bilingualism.sg/whats-up/news"> here.</a></b></p>

<div><h3> Call for Proposals</h3>
<div><p>The Lee Kuan Yew Fund for Bilingualism invites you to submit proposals to promote bilingualism among preschool children.</p></div><br>
<div><p>Bilingual education is a cornerstone of our education system. Learning two languages helps
Singaporeans plug into a globalised world and strengthen links to our Asian heritage.</p><div>
<div><p>Research has shown that exposure in early years is effective for nurturing bilingualism and the learning of multiple languages. Strengthening our efforts to encourage bilingualism in the early
years, especially in listening and speaking capabilities, would provide our children with a headstart in
language acquisition and lay a stronger foundation for bilingual learning in their later years.</p><div>
<div><p>The Lee Kuan Yew Fund for Bilingualism welcome  proposals that have the potential to create an impact on promoting bilingualism among preschool children in preschools, at home and in the
community. Please note that the Fund is currently not accepting any research-related proposals.</p><div>
<div><p><strong>The Fund has set specific periods for Call for Proposals (CFP) in January and July each year.  Proposals that are received outside of the CFP period will only be evaluated during the next CFP.  <br>When to apply:</strong></p><div>
