	<div id="box">Note to applicants:<br> 
The January 2024 Call for Proposals (CFP) is designated as a Special Call with  
a core focus on funding applications for bilingual events and programmes,  
for example: plays/dramas, booths/exhibitions, competitions, social media campaigns.</div>

<div><p>The Lee Kuan Yew Fund for Bilingualism invites you to submit proposals to promote bilingualism.</p></div><br>
<div><p>Bilingual education is a cornerstone of our education system. Learning two languages helps
Singaporeans plug into a globalised world and strengthen links to our Asian heritage.</p><div>
<div><p>Research has shown that exposure in early years is effective for nurturing bilingualism and the learning of multiple languages. Strengthening our efforts to encourage bilingualism in the early
years, especially in listening and speaking capabilities, would provide our children with a headstart in language acquisition and lay a stronger foundation for bilingual learning in their later years.</p><div>
<div><p><strong>The Fund has set specific periods for Call for Proposals (CFP) in January and July each year.  Proposals that are received outside of the CFP period will only be evaluated during the next CFP. </strong>

</p><div><p>Please note that the Fund is currently not accepting any research-related proposals.</p><div>
