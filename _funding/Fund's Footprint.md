<p>Since its inception, the Lee Kuan Yew Fund for Bilingualism has held true
to its mission of enabling a steady pipeline of locally contextualised
and age-appropriate resources and programmes to foster bilingualism in
children. The focus has been on pre-schoolers, or even younger children
because the foundation for learning both English and Mother Tongue Languages
(MTLs) is best laid when children are young. Besides focusing on pre-schoolers,
we have also broadened our focus to promote bilingualism as a lifelong
endeavour.</p>
<p>We work closely with like-minded stakeholders and community partners,
individuals and entities to support worthy initiatives and programmes in
making MTL learning fun and relevant to everyday life. Some of our fund-supported
programmes and events as well as its impact includes:</p>
<h4>Junction Tree</h4>
<p>“Junction Tree” is Singapore's first locally-produced, bilingual pre-school
programme. It is available in English-Chinese, English-Malay and English-Tamil
versions. “Junction Tree” won the "Best Preschool Programme" at the Asian
Academy Creative Awards in 2018. The programme can be viewed digital entertainment
platform <em><a href="https://www.mewatch.sg/en/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">MeWatch</a></em>.</p>
<h4>New World. New Life</h4>
<p>To commemorate the Singapore Bicentennial, Singapore Federation of Chinese
Clans Associations (SFCCA) showcased the "New World. New Life" exhibition
to pay tribute to our nation's forefathers. The bilingual (CL-EL) exhibition,
which was supported by LKYFB, is the biggest and longest multi-sensory
interactive exhibition ever held in 33 years of SFCCA's history.</p>
<h4>Tamil Language Council and the Malay Language Council Singapore</h4>
<p>Tamil Language Council and the Malay Language Council Singapore are the
main organisers of the Tamil Language Festival (TLF) and Malay Language
Month (Bulan Bahasa) respectively. TLF and Bulan Bahasa programmes are
developed and presented by community partners.</p>
<h4>Singapore Tamil Youth Conference</h4>
<p>Singapore Tamil Youth Conference is a biennial event organised by tertiary
students to discuss matters related to Tamil community and the teaching
and learning of Tamil language.</p>
