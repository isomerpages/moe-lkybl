<h4><strong>A. ABOUT THE FUND&nbsp;</strong></h4>
<p><strong>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is the Lee Kuan Yew Fund for Bilingualism?</strong>
</p>
<p>The Lee Kuan Yew Fund for Bilingualism was first announced at the launch
of &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lee Kuan Yew’s book, “My Lifelong Challenge: Singapore’s
Bilingual Journey” on 28 November 2011. The Fund is set up as a company
limited by guarantee, with Charity and Institution of a Public Character
(IPC) status.</p>
<p><strong>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who manages the Fund?</strong>
</p>
<p>The Fund is managed by its Board. The Board is supported by a Project
Evaluation Committee (PEC), Investment Advisory Committee (IAC), Publicity
and Outreach Resource Panel (PORP), Audit Committee (AC) and Research Advisory
Panel (RAP)</p>
<p><strong>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why was the Fund set up?</strong>
</p>
<p>The Fund was set up to promote bilingual education to supplement efforts
by the Ministry of Education (MOE) in the teaching and learning of the
English Language (EL) and the Mother Tongue Languages (MTLs). The Fund
aims to encourage bilingualism and the learning of our Mother Tongue Languages
as living languages and as a lifelong endeavour. To achieve this, the Fund
supports proposals to develop bilingualism and seeks to play a catalytic
role in seeding relevant initiatives.</p>
<p><strong>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will the Fund support proposals that focus on languages other than EL and the MTLs?</strong>
</p>
<p>The Fund is meant to help Singaporeans of all races to learn EL and the
official MTLs: Chinese, Malay and Tamil languages.</p>
<p><strong>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is the objective of the Fund?</strong>
</p>
<p>The Fund aims to raise the quality of teaching and learning of EL and
MTLs in the context of Singapore’s multicultural and socio-linguistic environment,
particularly in nurturing bilingualism among preschool children and youths/young
adults.</p>
<p><strong>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does the Fund focus on supporting certain types of proposals?</strong>
</p>
<p>The Fund is likely to support proposals which fall under one or more of
the following categories: (a) teaching and learning resources; (b) events;
and &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)
programmes.</p>
<p><strong>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How much will the Fund give out every year to supported proposals?</strong>
</p>
<p>The Fund will support worthy and good proposals. As such, there is no
maximum cap. However, the amount of funding given out depends on the nature
and scope of the project, as well as the availability of funds. Where necessary,
the Fund will also redirect worthy proposals to relevant organisations.</p>
<h4><strong>B.&nbsp;&nbsp; FUNDING PARAMETERS (FOR PROPOSALS)</strong></h4>
<p><strong>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are funding opportunities specific to proposals for preschool children? </strong>&nbsp;The
Fund will consider any worthy proposals targeted at preschool children
or youths, so long as it serves to promote bilingualism and bilingual education
in Singapore.</p>
<p><strong>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does the Fund support the full cost of the project?</strong>
</p>
<p>Applicants are advised to submit the indicative costs relating to the
project for the Fund’s consideration. All costs pertaining to the whole
duration of the project must be factored in and clearly stated in the
<a href="http://www.bilingualism.sg/funding/apply-for-grant" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Budget Proposal Form.</a>
</p>
<p><strong>10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does the Fund support all types of project costs?</strong>
</p>
<p>Funding support for proposals are subject to the Fund’s project funding
criteria and the achievement of committed targets. Examples of non-fundable
items can be found in the <a href="http://www.bilingualism.sg/funding/apply-for-grant" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Fund’s Application Guidelines.</a>
</p>
<p><strong>11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is the anticipated funding amount for each successful project?</strong>
</p>
<p>The approved funding amount for each project will depend on the nature
and scope of the project, as well as the availability of funds.</p>
<p><strong>12.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the point of application, will an individual applying for the Fund need to undergo an audit?</strong>
</p>
<p>No, an individual applying for the Fund will not have to undergo audits.
However, for organisations and institutions, submitted applications would
need to include certified copies of full sets of the audited financial
or management reports over the past three years.</p>
<p><strong>13.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can proposals supported by the Fund be funded by more than one grant? </strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, provided that there is no double-funding for the same expenditure.
We recognise that for some projects, applicants may need to source for
funding from multiple sources. So long as the funding requested from the
Fund is not already funded by another source, the Fund will consider the
application.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We require applicants to declare other sources of funding or potential
sources of funding (e.g. grants for which the applicants are in the process
of applying) within Part II of the <a href="http://www.bilingualism.sg/funding/apply-for-grant" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Budget Proposal Form.</a>
</p>
<p><strong>14.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there a maximum time validity for the supported funding?</strong>
</p>
<p>The maximum time validity of the funds awarded to each project will typically
be up to three years. Projects should be completed within this time frame.
Some projects may be given a longer time frame for completion on a case-by-case
basis.</p>
<p><strong>15.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will the Fund ask for a share of the profits if the supported proposal generates revenue?</strong>
</p>
<p>No, but the Fund may impose terms and conditions when the offer of the
grant is made to successful applicants.</p>
<p><strong>16.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can I retain intellectual property (IP) rights for the project?</strong>
</p>
<p>Successful applicants will retain the IP rights for supported projects.
However, the Fund may propose different ownership structures of the IP
or conditions of use of the IP, on a case-by-case basis where there is
good reason. This will be clearly indicated in the Project Agreement to
successful applicants.</p>
<h4><strong>C.&nbsp;&nbsp; ELIGIBILITY FOR FUNDING APPLICATION</strong></h4>
<p><strong>17.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who is eligible to apply for the Fund?</strong>
</p>
<p>The Fund is open to individuals, and organisations/institutions. All applicants
should have the relevant experience and expertise to implement the project.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Organisations and institutions must be registered with Singapore authorities
such as the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA) and Registry
of Societies (ROS).</p>
<p><strong>18.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do applicants have to be Singapore-based to be eligible for a funding application? Can foreigners apply?</strong>
</p>
<p>Foreigners or organisations based overseas may apply for the Fund. However,
there would be a preference for applicants who are working in partnership
with locally-based organisations. This is to ensure that the project takes
into account the unique socio-linguistic context of Singapore.</p>
<p><strong>19.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are for-profit organisations allowed to apply for the Fund?</strong>
</p>
<p>Yes, for-profit organisations may apply for the Fund.</p>

</p>
<p><strong>21.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When can I apply?</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>The Fund has specific Calls for Proposals (CFP) periods and only accepts proposals received in January and July each year</strong>.
Proposals may also sometimes be received through applications made for
Bulan Bahasa, Tamil Language Festival and Tamil Youth Festival.</p>
<p>Applicants are advised that the Fund requires Grantees to take in the
Fund’s input to our satisfaction. Please factor in additional time for
vetting and printing/production before the launch date, especially for
print and digital resources, and submit your applications in the appropriate
CFP period of January or July.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Proposals that are received outside of the CFP period will only be evaluated
during the next CFP. Expenses incurred before the projects are approved
will not be eligible for funding.</p>
<p><strong>22.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do I have to submit a single complete application or may I send it in parts? </strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All applications have to be submitted as a single complete application.
Only complete applications will be evaluated.</p>
<p><strong>23.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can I submit more than one proposal?</strong>
</p>
<p>Yes, applicants may submit more than one proposal. Each proposal will
be evaluated with a set of pre-determined evaluation criteria.</p>
<p><strong>24.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can I collaborate with other organisations/institutions to submit proposals?</strong>
</p>
<p>Yes, joint proposals may be submitted.</p>
<p><strong>25.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can I submit a manual application form and submit my proposals via e-mail or through a manual submission?</strong>
</p>
<p>No. Only submissions made online via the links provided via LKYFB’s
<a href="http://www.bilingualism.sg/funding/apply-for-grant" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">website</a>only.</p>
<h4><strong>E. PROCESSING OF APPLICATIONS</strong></h4>
<p><strong>26.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is the selection process?</strong>
</p>
<p>The Fund will only evaluate proposals with complete applications. The
Fund’s Programme Office may contact applicants to ask for further details.
All applicants will be notified of the final outcome. Successful applicants
will receive a Letter of Offer stating the terms and conditions of the
funding support. A Project Agreement will be signed between the Fund and
successful applicants.</p>
<p><strong>27.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How are the proposals evaluated?</strong>
</p>
<p>Proposals will be evaluated using a set of pre-determined evaluation criteria
that consider the application’s relevance, impact, scalability, sustainability
and the potential of the applicant. Details of the evaluation criteria
can be found in the <a href="http://www.bilingualism.sg/funding/apply-for-grant" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Fund Application Guidelines.</a>
</p>
<p><strong>28.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How soon can successful applicants receive funding?</strong>
</p>
<p>Successful applicants can generally expect the first tranche of funds
to be disbursed one month after signing the Project Agreement.</p>
<p><strong>29.       Who evaluates and approves the proposals? What is the Fund’s basis for approval of proposals?</strong>
</p>
<p>All proposals are reviewed and evaluated by the Project Evaluation Committee
(PEC) based on a set of evaluation criteria that consider the application’s
relevance, impact, scalability, sustainability and the potential of the
applicant.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The members of the PEC have the relevant expertise and experience to assess
the quality and worthiness of the proposals received. Where applicable,
other experts and specialists such as those from within MOE are also consulted.
Depending on the quantum of funding requested, either the PEC or the Board
(considering the recommendations of the PEC) approves the proposals.</p>
<p><strong>30.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are proposals that focus only on one language accepted? If they are, are they less preferred than proposals that cover two or more languages?</strong>
</p>
<p>While we do accept proposals that cover only one language, the evaluation
considers the relevance and impact of the proposal in promoting bilingual
education.</p>
<p><strong>31.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can rejected applicants appeal for reconsideration of their proposals?</strong>
</p>
<p>The Fund does not accept appeals. However, applicants whose proposals
have not been supported may revise their proposal and submit it again.
The Fund adopts an open approach and will review proposals that are refined
and revised.</p>
<p><strong>32.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can current grantees with ongoing projects apply for funds?</strong>
</p>
<p>No. LKYFB is currently not accepting any applications made by applicants
with ongoing projects that have yet to be completed.&nbsp;The new application
would be automatically withdrawn and will not be considered.</p>
