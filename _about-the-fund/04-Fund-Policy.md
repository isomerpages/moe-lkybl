  <h4  style= "text-decoration: underline;">Policy</h4>
  <p>1.    This   policy   addresses   the   commitment   of   the   Lee Kuan   Yew   Fund  for Bilingualism  (“the  Fund”)  to  integrity  and  ethical behavior  by  helping  to  foster  and maintain an environment where all its stakeholders can act appropriately, without fear of retaliation.  To  maintain  these  standards,  the  Fund encourages  its  stakeholders  who have concerns about suspected serious misconduct or any breach or suspected breach of law or regulation that may adversely impact the Fund, to come forward and express these concerns without fear of punishment or unfair treatment.</p>
<p>2.     The  Fund  runs  its  operations  based  on  the  principles  of  fairness,  honesty, openness,  decency,  integrity  and  respect.  It  is  the  Fund’s  policy  to  support  and encourage  its  stakeholders  to  report  and  disclose  improper  or  illegal  activities,  and  to fully investigate such reports and disclosures. It is also the Fund’s policy to address any complaints  that  allege  acts  or  attempted  acts  of  interference,  reprisal,  retaliation, threats, coercion or intimidation against stakeholders who report, disclose or investigate improper  or  illegal  activities  (the  “Whistleblowers”)  and  to  protect  those  who  come forward to report such activities. The Fund assures that all reports will be treated strictly confidentially  and  promptly  investigated  and  that  reports  can  be made anonymously,  if desired. </p>
<p>3.    The Fund’s internal control and operating procedures are intended to detect and to  prevent  or  deter  improper  activities.  However,  even  the  best  systems  of  controls cannot   provide   absolute   safeguards   against   irregularities.   The   Fund   has   the responsibility  to  investigate  and  report  to  appropriate  parties,  allegations  of  suspected improper activities and to take appropriate actions. Stakeholders are encouraged to use guidance provided by this policy for reporting all allegations of suspected misconduct or improper activities.  </p>
<h4 style= "text-decoration: underline;">Objective and Scope of Policy </h4>
<p>4. The Whistle Blowing Policy (“the Code”) is intended to: 
  <ul>
  <li>To  provide  avenues  for  stakeholders  to  raise  concerns  and  define  a  way  to handle these concerns. </li>
  <li>To enable the Board of Directors to be informed at an early stage about acts of misconduct.  </li>
  <li>To  reassure  stakeholders  that  they  will  be  protected  from  punishment  or unfair treatment for disclosing concerns in good faith in accordance with this procedure.  </li>
  <li>To help develop a culture of openness, accountability and integrity.  </li>
  <li>To  encourage  stakeholders  to  feel  confident  in  raising  serious       concerns  and to question and act upon their concerns.  </li>
  <li>To ensure that stakeholders get a response to their concerns.  </li>
  <li>To  reassure  stakeholders  that  if  they  raise  any  concerns  in  good  faith  and reasonably  believe  them  to  be  true,  they  will  be  protected  from  possible reprisals or victimization, to the extent where the situation allows </li></ul></p>
  <p>5. Specific   examples   relating   to   unlawful   conduct, accounting   malpractice   or dangers to the public or environment could include:

        <li>Any  misrepresentation  whether  actual  or  suspected by  an  officer  or  auditor regarding  a  matter  contained  or  required  to  be  contained  in  the  Fund’s financial records, reports or audit reports. </li>
          <li>Information  relating  to  any  of  the  above  being  deliberately  concealed  or attempts are being made to conceal the same</li></ul></p>

         <li>Information  relating  to  any  of  the  above  being  deliberately  concealed  or attempts are being made to conceal the same</li></ul></p>
  <p>7. This Policy governs the reporting and investigation of improper or illegal activities at the Fund, as well as the protection offered to the “Whistleblowers”.  </p>
  <p>8. The Code will cover all stakeholders which includes:
   <ul><li>Board Members; </li>
    <li> Committee Members;</li>
    <li>Secretariats; and</li>

  <h4  style= "text-decoration: underline;">Definitions </h4>
  <h4>Whistleblower  </h4>
  <p>9. A  person  or  entity  making  a  protected  disclosure  about  improper  or  illegal activities is commonly referred to as a whistleblower. Whistleblowers may be the Fund stakeholders or general public. The whistleblower’s role is as a reporting party. They are not, investigators or finders of fact, nor do they determine the appropriate corrective or remedial action that may be warranted.</p>
  <h4>Good Faith  </h4>
  <p>10. Good faith is evident when the report is made without malice or consideration of personal benefit and the whistleblower has a reasonable basis to believe that the report is true; provided, however, a report does not have to be proven to be true to be made in good faith. Good faith is lacking when the disclosure is known to be malicious or false. </p>
    <h4>Misconduct / Improper Activities  </h4>
  <p>11. Examples  of  misconduct  include,  but  not  limited  to,  fraud,  including  financial fraud and accounting fraud, violation of laws and regulations, violation of Fund policies, unethical behavior or practices, endangerment to public health or safety and negligence of duty.</p>  
  <h4  style= "text-decoration: underline;">Procedures </h4>
  <p>12. This policy presumes that whistleblowers will act in good faith and will not make false  accusations  when  reporting  of  misconduct.    A whistleblower  who  knowingly  or recklessly makes statements or disclosures that are not in good faith may be subject to disciplinary procedures, which may include termination. Whistleblowers who report acts of misconduct pursuant to this policy can and will continue to be required to adhere to the Fund’s policies and procedures. </p>  
<h4>Reporting Allegations of Misconduct or Improper Activities </h4>
  <p>13. Any  person  may  report  allegations  of  suspected serious  misconduct  or  any breach  or  suspected  breach  of  law  or  regulation  that  may  adversely  impact  the  Fund, the Fund’s stakeholders or the public at large</p>  
  <p>14. Acts  of  misconduct  must  be  disclosed  in  writing,  so  as  to  assure  a  clear understanding of the issues raised. The format provided in Appendix A may be used for reporting purposes. </p>  
<p>15. Individuals are recommended to self-identify, though it is not a requirement of the policy.</p>  
 <p>16. The Audit Committee will review allegations of suspected serious misconduct or any  breach  or  suspected  breach  of  law  or  regulation  that  may  adversely  impact  the Fund,  the  Fund’s  stakeholders  or  the  public  at  large.  All  reports  should  be  sent  to  the Audit  Committee.  Contact  information of  the  Chairperson of  the  Audit  Committee  is as follows: 
  Chairperson, Audit Committee <br/>
   Lee Kuan Yew Fund for Bilingualism<br/>
   1 North Buona Vista Drive<br/>
   Singapore 138675 <br/>
   c/o: Financial Management Branch 
  </p>  
  <p>17. Although the whistleblower is not expected to prove the truth of an allegation, he / she needs to demonstrate to the person contacted that there are sufficient grounds for concern. </p>  
<h4>Investigating Alleged Misconduct or Improper Activities  </h4>
  <p>18. The Chairperson of the Audit Committee will notify the sender and acknowledge receipt of the reported violation or suspected violation within five business days.</p>  
  <p>19. The  Audit  Committee  has  the  responsibility  to  conduct  investigations  and  will ensure  investigations  are  carried  out  using  appropriate  channels,  resources  and expertise. In addition, other parties may also be involved in the investigations.
    <ul><li>The Audit Committee may meet to discuss the action / investigation on the reports  received  from  whistleblowers.  The  Committee  may  also  exclude from  its  meetings  any  persons  it  deems  appropriate,  depending  on  the nature of the complaint.</li>
    <li>Some concerns may be resolved by agreed action without the need for an investigation.  Concerns  about  allegations  which  fall  within  the  scope  of specific  procedures  of  the  Fund  will  be  referred  for  consideration  under those procedures. </li></ul></p>  
  <p>20. The Audit Committee will report to the Chairman of the Board on a periodic basis about the reports received and actions taken.</p>  
  <p>21. The  Board  of  Directors  reserves  the  right  to  make  any  decision  based  on  the findings by the Audit Committee.</p>
   <p>22. When a concern is raised, the whistleblower must indicate if the concern is to be treated in confidence. The extent off the confidentiality  will be determined by the Audit Committee  </p>
   <p>23. Whilst  the  purpose  of  this  Code  is  to  enable  the  Fund  to  investigate  possible malpractice and take appropriate steps to deal with it, it may not be possible to disclose the  precise  action  taken  where  this  would  infringe a  duty  of  confidence  owed  by  us  to someone else. </p>
  <h4>Safeguards for the Whistleblowers</h4>
   <p>24. The  Fund  will  not  tolerate  any  harassment  or  victimization  (including  formal pressures) and will take appropriate action to protect those who raise a concern in good faith. </p>
   <p>25. No  action  will  be  taken  against  anyone  who  makes  an  allegation  in  good  faith, reasonably believing it to be true, even if the allegation is not subsequently confirmed by the investigation.</p>
   <p>26. Every  effort  will  be  made  to  ensure  confidentiality  as  far  as  this  is  reasonably practical</p>
   <p>27. Help  will  be  provided  to  the  whistleblowers  in order  to  minimize  any  difficulties which one may experience</p>
 <h4  style= "text-decoration: underline;">Roles and Responsibilities </h4>
